# Local LLama Chrome Extension
## What is this?

This is a chrome extension that allows you to query the llama-cpp-python models while in the browser. It uses a local server to handle the queries and display the results in a popup.

## Showcase

## Prerequisites

llama-cpp-python must be installed and some models must be downloaded. See [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) for more information.
Models available for download from huggingface:
- [TheBlokeAI](
https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/)
i'v been using:
- [TheBlokeAI/Llama-2-7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GGUF)
for my testing but most of the gguf models should work.
obviously the bigger the model the slower the query. and the more ram it will use.
